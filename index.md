# Twitter Engagement Analysis

### Methodology

This project is an attempt to analyze the changing activity level of twitter users on a quarter to quarter basis. The results are obtained using the twitter REST API and displayed with graphs generated by plotly. The program gathers approximately 2000 users who have recently interacted with a tweet from an account with a high number of followers (Like former President Barack Obama ([@BarackObama](https://twitter.com/barackobama)) or Pop Star Katy Perry ([@KatyPerry](https://twitter.com/katyperry)) and produces results for two classes of users:
1. Users who had an account prior to 2016
2. Users who created an account in Q1 2016

It is worth noting that due to limitations of the twitter API, only users with fewer than 3200 tweets are analyzed. The program gathers and plots the total number of likes, retweets, and tweets by all users per quarter, divided by the number of users analyzed. Of the 2000 gathered users, approximately 100 met criteria 1 and about X users met criteria 2. The following plot is created using the plotly API and is interactive.
